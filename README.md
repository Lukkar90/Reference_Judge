![how_program_works](docs/images/how_program_works.png)

## Getting Started 💡

Run `python Reference_Judge` command line in the directory where the folder exists

To run only UI version you don't have to provide any arguments, just press "enter"

If you want to use the console: [**How to use console**](docs/How_to_use_console.md)

standalone exe version of a program is here: [link](https://gofile.io/d/DlYQ0I)

You can also create your own executable: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZX5kH72Yx4)

## Using UI version 👀

![main window](docs/images/main_window.png)

1. Firstly, you choose the **source** folder/file/url to **process**
2. Next, you choose the **target** folder/file/url to **compare** to
3. Later, you check **mode** in which you want to display images:

- **Save**
- **Show**

4. In **save mode** you choose the folder in which your matches will be saved  
   To do that you have to provide a **path** in the **output dialog** box

- When a name should be the **same as in source**, provide the output path as a **folder**
- When a name should be **specified**, provide the output path as a **file**

5. In **show mode** there will be automatically displayed matched images  
   To go to the next set of images press **"0"** key

6. The **width** dialog is responsible for the size in which images will be rendered  
   minimal value is **1**, maximal value is **1080**, it's set mainly for performance reasons

7. The checkbox **Search by the ratio** enables searching similar images with different sizes but only with the same ratio  
   sizes of **original** image compared to **target** image are from **0.5** to **4.0** times  
   any ratios of **target** images below or above these values are disregarded  
   Generally, it's not recommended to use this option due to image distortions

8. The final step is to push the button **"Match images"**  
   Depending on a number of images to process results should appear fairly fast  
   Images are automatically **matched** on the degree of **similarity**  
   The **naming** of files does **not matter** in that case

9. **Enjoy** the results!

## Errors ⚠️

![errors](docs/images/errors.png)

1. If you use **"Save mode"**:  
   When **errors occur**, then it will be **created .txt** file where **errors** are **stored**  
   **.txt** file is **stored** in the selected folder **in output** folder  
   Each **.txt** file looks like: **ERROR-(date when the script ran).txt**:

2. If you use **"Show mode"**:  
   When **errors occur**, then pop-up window with listed **"not found"** files matches will appear

For both modes you will get pop-up notification about the quantity of **errors**

### Type of **errors**:

- When there is no match for **source** image among **target** images
- When **matched** images are not saved

## Setup 💾

![setup menu](docs/images/setup.png)

The areas marked **in red** are **options** which can be **saved**, **loaded** as setup files  
Setups are stored in **"program/data/appData/"**

To process setups, in menu **"Setup"** are located following options:

1. **Save as**, save current setup into **.ini** file
2. **Open**, open setup **.ini** file
3. **Save to defaults**, save current setup as **defaults** (**load that** setup each time when **program starts**)
4. **Reset to defaults**, load **defaults**
5. **Defaults reset**, overwrite **defaults** to **standard** values and **load** them

## Logs 📜

![logs menu](docs/images/logs.png)

In this menu, you can choose if **errors logs** appear or not  
In **Save mode** errors logs are saved in output directory  
In **Show mode** errors logs are shown in pop-up box

## Help ℹ️

![help menu](docs/images/help.png)

It consists of:

- How to use program
- About (program and it's creator)

## Program config 🕹️

In `./Reference_Judge/config/config.py` you will find constants  
used through the whole program

Inside you can change:

- read image **types** (e.g .png)
- **ARGVs** names
- **images properties**
- or in what **conditions** matches images are **found**

Python is the only language used in the project, so for convenience to keep types right, config is just .py

## Running the tests 🧪

To run tests, write down in the terminal, in the program folder:
`python tests.py`
